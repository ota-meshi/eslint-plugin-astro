        Create a minimal reproduction of the problem. **A minimal reproduction is required** so that others can help debug your issue. If a report is vague (e.g. just a generic error message) and has no reproduction, it may be closed.  
        [Why Reproductions are Required](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required)

        Be sure to share the repo on GitHub (or Demo site link). GitHub's repo is ready to debug using Codespace.  
        Please DON'T USE non-GitHub repos such as GitLab as repro.  
        It takes me a long time to prepare my local PC for debugging.  
        Please DON'T USE stackblitz as a repro.  
        We can't debug eslint with stackblitz.
