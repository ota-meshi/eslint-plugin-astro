> apply `jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions` rule to Astro components

This rule is the same rule as [jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions] rule but it applies to the Astro components.  
You must have [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y] installed to use this rule.

[eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y]: https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y
[jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions]: https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y/tree/HEAD/docs/rules/no-static-element-interactions.md

However, this rule probably doesn't work for Astro components because Astro components don't provide an event listener as syntax.
